###To Do's &amp; Thoughts
-------------------------
1. Setup category filtering...possibly use JSON &amp; RESTful service? </li>
2. Refactor JS - initial loading transition(s) showcase issues now &amp; again.</li>
3. Check performance on mobile &amp; tablet.  Update CSS &amp; JS accordingly. </li>
4. Take advantage of modernizr &amp; Irish conditional <html> for cross browser compatabilty.</li>

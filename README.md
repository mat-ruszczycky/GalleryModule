To Do's &amp; Thoughts
=============
* Setup category filtering...possibly use JSON &amp; RESTful service? 
* Refactor JS - initial loading transition(s) showcase issues now &amp; again. 
* Check performance on mobile &amp; tablet.  Update CSS &amp; JS accordingly.  
* Take advantage of modernizr &amp; Irish conditional <html> for cross browser compatabilty.
